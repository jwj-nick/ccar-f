    problem: 'You split a research task across a coordinator and several subagents. Why give each subagent its OWN context window instead of one shared thread? What failure does isolation prevent — and what is the cost you pay for it?',
    hint: 'Think about token budget, cross-task interference/distraction, and how the subagents’ results get merged back by the coordinator.'

      covered: '5 workflow patterns — recognized by data-flow shape (re-done solo, interactive)',
      insight: 'Read the SHAPE of the flow, not the concept: linear steps = chaining · classify→branch = routing · fan-out→merge = parallelization · runtime decomposition = orchestrator-workers · generate↔evaluate loop = evaluator-optimizer. The money distinction: routing = pick from a fixed set of bins; orchestrator = build the bins at runtime and aggregate.',
      analogy: 'chaining = pipeline stages with assertions · parallelization = parallel units / TMR voting · evaluator-optimizer = coverage-closure loop.',
      result: 'Solo-distinguished the two hardest pairs: routing↔orchestrator and voting↔evaluator-optimizer.'

      date: '2026-07-18', dom: 'D1', ses: 'S3', mode: 'standard',
      covered: 'routing vs orchestrator boundary, and where an orchestrator crosses into a true agent (interactive)',
      insight: 'Deciding property for routing vs orchestrator is NOT "which one does it pick" (both pick) — it is: can you enumerate the whole task list before any request arrives, AND is there a merge? Enumerable + no merge = routing; built at runtime + aggregated = orchestrator. Orchestrator → agent line: an orchestrator has dynamic CONTENT but a fixed one-pass control flow (decompose → dispatch → merge). It becomes an agent only when a feedback loop appears — the model observes results, decides the next action from them, and decides when to stop.',
      analogy: 'Orchestrator = directed regression dispatched once. Agent = constrained-random + coverage-closure: observe coverage → generate the next stimulus → loop until closure.',
      result: 'Passed the trap APPLY: a per-document field-extraction pipeline that "decides at runtime" is still orchestrator, because there is no feedback loop. "Runtime-dynamic" alone does NOT make it an agent.'
